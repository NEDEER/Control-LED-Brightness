# ðŸ¤šðŸ’¡ Hand Gesture Controlled LED Brightness with Arduino

This project demonstrates how to **control the brightness of an LED using hand gestures** detected via a **webcam**. Using **Python**, the **CVZone** library, and an **Arduino**, the system tracks the distance between fingers and adjusts the LED's brightness in real-time through PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Real-time gesture tracking using a PC camera
- Adjust LED brightness by changing the distance between thumb and index finger
- Smooth analog control using Arduino PWM output
- Serial communication between Python and Arduino

## âœ¨ How It Works

1. The **webcam** captures the hand in real-time.
2. Python uses **CVZone's HandTrackingModule** to detect landmarks on the hand.
3. The distance between the **thumb and index finger tips** is calculated.
4. This distance is mapped to a value between **0 and 255**.
5. The value is sent to the **Arduino via serial**, which adjusts the **PWM signal** to change LED brightness.
